GitHub Submission Link: git@github.com:mks65/09_construction.git
Task at hand

    Create a struct that has at least 2 data members, one must be a string.
    Donâ€™t just combine random things, make it meaningful (like food and price, athlete and associated statistic, Pokemon and something about Pokemon ..)
    Write a function that prints out variables of your structs type in a reasonable way.
    Write a function that creates a new struct in heap memory, it should have paramteters appropraite to your struct.
    Write a main function that tests all these things.
        Have your program randomly assign some part of your struct each time it is run.
    Have meaningful output.
    DONT FORGET A MAKEFILE
    You can find the demo code from class here: https://github.com/mks65/dwsource/blob/main/structy.c
